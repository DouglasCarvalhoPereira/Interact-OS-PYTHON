# üñ•Ô∏è Interact-OS-PYTHON

This repository contains a course and associated projects focused on interacting with the operating system using Python. The projects explore various aspects of system-level programming, including file manipulation, process control, and more.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **M1**: Completed work for the first week.
- **M2**: Contents and projects from Module 2.
- **M3**: Working on the final project for Module 3.
- **M4**: Final project for Module 4.
- **M5**: Introduction and work on MD5 hashing in Module 5.
- **M6**: Continued work on the final project for Module 6.
- **M7**: Final updates for the final project.
- **ambOSPy**: Final project work related to interacting with the OS.
- **to_html.py**: Python script related to the final project.

## üéØ Objective

The primary objective of this course is to teach how to interact with the operating system using Python. This includes:

- **File Management**: Reading, writing, and manipulating files and directories.
- **Process Control**: Managing processes, including launching and terminating applications.
- **System Information**: Gathering details about the system, such as hardware and software configurations.
- **Security**: Implementing security measures like MD5 hashing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You may also need to install additional libraries depending on the specific project.

### Running the Scripts

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Module**: Enter the directory for the module you want to explore:
   ```bash
   cd M1
   ```
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python scripts as needed. For example:
   ```bash
   python to_html.py
   ```

### Course Overview

The course is structured into several modules (M1, M2, etc.), each focusing on different aspects of OS interaction with Python. The modules include theoretical lessons as well as practical projects to reinforce the learning process.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used across all projects.
- **C/C++**: Some modules include interaction with C and C++ for deeper system integration.
- **PowerShell & Fortran**: Used in specific modules to interact with the OS.
- **Cython**: For optimizing Python code and interfacing with C/C++.
